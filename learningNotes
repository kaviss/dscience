Linear Regression - 

How Gradient desent parabola arrived .
Map Residual Square ( Loss function value ) to Slope 

when the slope increases , error reduces and this when plotted gives parabola 
So our aim is to reach the minima of parabola and slope value of that would be the least value for loss function 


Ridge Regression - Penality square 

1. Used when you want to penalize the higher slope and to avoid overfitting during linear regression ( Least Square method ) 
2. How to Penalize . 
    Least square cost function - (y-y^)
    Ridge - (y-y^)2 / lambda + slope2 
    
3. So here the     



Lasso Regression
